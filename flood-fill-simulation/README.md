# 🌊 Flood Fill Algorithm Simulation (C)

This project simulates the flood fill algorithm in C — a method used to determine and fill connected regions in graphics.

## 🧠 Why this project?
Flood fill is commonly used in image processing (e.g., the paint bucket tool). I built this simulation to practice problem-solving and understand how algorithmic techniques are implemented in lower-level languages.

## 📁 Files
- `flood_fill_simulation.c`: Contains the full C implementation

## ▶ How to Run
Compile and run using a C compiler:
```bash
gcc flood_fill.c -o flood_fill
./flood_fill
